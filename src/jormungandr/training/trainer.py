"""
The trainer script is responsible for training the Jormungandr model. It includes functions for loading data, defining the training loop, and evaluating the model's performance. The trainer will utilize the output head defined in `output_head.py` to compute the loss and update the model's parameters during training. It will also handle saving and loading model checkpoints, as well as logging training metrics for analysis.
It shall be able to train the model on a given dataset, and evaluate its performance on a validation set. The trainer will also include functionality for hyperparameter tuning and early stopping based on validation performance. Additionally, it will support distributed training across multiple GPUs if available.
It shall be able to customize the training process with different optimizers, learning rate schedulers, and loss functions. The trainer will also include functionality for visualizing training progress and results, such as plotting loss curves and displaying sample predictions on the validation set. Overall, the trainer will be a crucial component in the development and optimization of the Jormungandr model for object detection tasks.
It shall be able to train both the Fafnir and Jormungandr models

It shall use:
* Torch
* Torchvision for data loading and augmentation
* Wandb for logging and visualization
*
